### Burst

# What is it?
Burst is a nonrevolutionary addition to JavaSwing that makes adding images just *slightly* easier

# Why did I make it?
Because I have way too much free time in class

# Does it work
Sort of. I need to make it not a rip-off of flixel, fix the animation classes, and add some Java flare
